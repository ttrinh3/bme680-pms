# Wildfire Project Summary
The idea of this project is to provide a tailored low cost IoT solution for forest wildfire prevention. 
## What?
The system is a sensor network, which consists of 3 main parts: 1) gathering nodes, 2) central node, 3) central server.
The gathering nodes collect data through an array of sensors and transmit them to a central node. The central node processes the data and decides whether or not the received data is indicative of a fire. The central server is an optional component that provides access to cloud-related services such as hosting databases or machine learning platforms or something else idk we didn't get there yet. 

## How?

Because this project was initiated by uninspired collegiate individuals, the budget is basically pocket change, and the design will reflect that. 

The idea is to capture short-term/immediate environmental changes brought upon by fires, and this job would be done by the below sensors:
1) BME680
The BME680 is sensitive to pressure, gas, temperature and humidity changes.
2) PMS5003 PM Sensor
This detects particulate matter

Fires would ideally alter these values in a specific manner, and a well designed algorithm or machine learning model would be sensitive to these.
