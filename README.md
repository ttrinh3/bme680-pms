# Tasks
## LoRa
[ ] Figure out NPT synching\
[ ] Encrypt sent data with Digital Signature [example](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/blob/5b11895700/examples/protocols/mqtt/ssl_ds/README.md)\
[ ] Learn how it works?

## ULP
[ ] Poll gas resistance and compare it to threshold\
[ ] Figure out what the threshold should be\
[ ] [SHT31 ULP RISC-V Example](https://github.com/bw38/esp32s2_examples/blob/4b3270954448f41de7a48d246e070044fe03465c/riscv_sht31/main/ulp/riscv_sht31.c)\
[ ] [BME 280 ULP RISC-V Example](https://github.com/bw38/esp32s2_examples/tree/4b3270954448f41de7a48d246e070044fe03465c/riscv_bme280)

## Data Verification
[ ] ULP has woken up SoC, now use the rest of the sensors to verify fire\
